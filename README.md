# harmony-second-feature

Demo workspace for a Feature team building with Harmony

This repository is where a second feature team owns and builds a specific feature that is integrated to the shell.
This allows for a complete independent workflow for the feature team where they can run the complete app in their local environment.

notice that this feature team integrates to a UI owned by the "first" feature team, but still allows for complete independet flow.

this workspace allows for independent build for the team and even independent deployment to a staging/testing environment of the feature team.

To run the application:

```
bit install
bit run app-shell --watch
```
